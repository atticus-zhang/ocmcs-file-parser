So TMC proctors, you like proctoring by sitting on your butt I see. Don't worry we don't judge, we here at OCMC are quite good at butt sitting ourselves. Don't wanna go in and manually parse your scans into individual documents? Don't wanna rename each file? Well worry no more! Thank god for modern technology am I right?
